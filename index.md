# This is a large header 

## This is a slightly smaller header

This is body of the subsection that I am writing about

### This is a sub-sub section header. How many of these can we make? 

This is a way to make unordered lists:
* first bullet point
* second bullet point
* third bullet point


This is an ordered list: 
1. First item in ordered list
1. Second item in an ordered list. I am suprised that this will continue to be ordered even if we don't put a number two


Now I will add in a figure
